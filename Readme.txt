This is repository to preserve my finial codes of my master thesis research.
The first step of the research was reconstruction of data, which is transform unstructured data to structured data.
The Belle II software framework was applied to reconstruct the data 
After the structured data(DataFrame), I did data analysis with machine learning to identify specific particles
from data. 
Grid computing(distributed CPU) was necessary to run the codes with tremendous amount of data. 



Master_thesis_Jiyong.pdf: Thesis file.

Steering_file.py: Based on Belle II software framework for reconstruction of data. 
It is crucial file to control the data in this research.

HTCondor: This directory has some files for grid computing. A manual is included.

Machine Learning: Directory that keeps many files for machine learning.

Rest of files: Data analysis to search for the particles and distinguish background particles.
